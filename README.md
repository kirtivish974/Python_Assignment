# Python_Assignment
🚀 Beginner-to-Intermediate Python Assignments | Covering fundamentals, problem-solving, and hands-on coding practice
📌 This project is a collection of fundamental Python concepts explained and demonstrated through Jupyter Notebook and supporting documentation. It was created as part of my learning journey to strengthen core programming foundations before moving into advanced fields like Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.

🚀 Topics Covered

✅ Introduction to Python & its popularity

✅ Interpreter vs Compiler in Python

✅ Pre-defined Keywords & Variable Naming Rules

✅ Mutability vs Immutability

✅ == vs is Operators

✅ Logical Operators (and, or, not)

✅ Type Casting (Implicit & Explicit)

✅ Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

✅ Loops (for vs while)

✅ Real-world examples for loop selection


🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Key Learnings

Understood the importance of mutability in data structures (lists vs tuples).

Learned how to apply conditional logic for decision-making in code.

Practiced type casting to make data more usable in operations.

Differentiated when to use for loops vs while loops in real-world scenarios.

🎯 Next Steps

Apply these concepts in mini data projects (e.g., calculators, text analysis, data handling).

Transition from fundamentals to Data Science & Generative AI applications.
